# ammonium-nitrate-facilities
## State records provided: 

This repo contains records provided to the Center for Public Integrity in response to a 2019 request for lists of facilities where ammonium nitrate is handed, sold or stored. Under EPCRA, Public Integrity sought records from 16 states, including the nationâ€™s top agricultural producers and ones identified by the federal government as having the largest concentration of such facilities.

This repo contains records provided by Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wisconsin.

A few states provide chemical and facility information to the public online and others produced the information when requested. Some states declined to provide any information or would only provide details if a requester inquired about a specific facility.
